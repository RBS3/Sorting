# Sorting Algorithm Performance Comparison

This project compares the performance of two classic sorting algorithms: **Bubble Sort** and **Selection Sort**. The goal is to analyze the time taken by each algorithm to sort random lists of numbers.

### Algorithms Used

1. **Bubble Sort**:
   - A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
   - Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
   - Time complexity: O(n²).

2. **Selection Sort**:
   - A comparison-based algorithm that divides the input into two parts: sorted and unsorted.
   - It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
   - Time complexity: O(n²).

### Purpose
This project aims to:
- Compare the performance (in terms of time taken) of Bubble Sort and Selection Sort on random input arrays.
- Showcase the time complexity behavior of these algorithms for different input sizes (50 and 1000).

### Features
- Generates random floating-point numbers for input.
- Measures the time it takes for each algorithm to sort arrays of various sizes.
- Compares the performance for two different input sizes: 50 and 1000.
